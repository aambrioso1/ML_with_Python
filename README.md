## [Chapter 1](https://github.com/aambrioso1/ML_with_Python/blob/master/Chapter_1_Introduction.ipynb)  

Introduction (Completed 6/10)
### Highlights
* Introduction to Python
* List of libraries that need to be imported to complete all examples in the book.
* Definitions of supervised and unsupervised learning
* Explanation of the k-nearest Neighbor algortithm for ML (kNN)
* A nice example for identifying Iris species using supervised learning and a kNN


### Ideas
* Write a function or class for performing the kNN learning of this example:  
`def kNN(data, target): pass`
* Create an identifier for digits based on asterisk patterns that look like digits
* Create an identifier for digit based on the MNIST database.
