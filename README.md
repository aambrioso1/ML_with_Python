Folder for course on my local machine:  C:\Users\Alex\machine-learning\ML_with_Python


## Necessary imports
* import numpy as np
* import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
* import pandas as pd
* import mglearn
* from iPython.display import display



## Chapter 1:  Introduction (Completed 6/10)
Highlights
* Introduction to Python
* List of libraries that need to be imported to complete all examples in the book.
* Definitions of supervised and unsupervised learning
* Explanation of the k-nearest Neighbor algortithm for ML (kNN)
* A nice example for identifying Iris species using supervised learning and a kNN


## Ideas
* Write a function or class for performing the kNN learning of this example:  
'def kNN(data, target): pass
* Create an identifier for digits based on asterisk patterns that look like digits
* Create an identifier for digit based on the MNIST database.
